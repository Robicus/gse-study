# gse-study
Welcome to the one stop shop for studying and mastering the SANS GSE exam objectives.

The gse-study repo was assembled to serve as a consolidated, and comprehensive, study solution for the SANS GSE exam.

## How To Navigate the Repo

The repo is a collection of directories and files (.md) that align to the GIAC GSE exam objectives and outcomes.  For example, the GSE exam objectives align to 5 primary categories:  IDS and Traffic Analysis Domain, Incident Handling Domain, ITSEC Domain, Security Technologies Domain, and Soft Skills Domain.  Each of these primary categories are further broken down into specific sub-categories.  For example, the IDS and Traffic Analysis Domain is broken down into the following sub-categories:  Capture Traffic, Analyze Traffic, Interpret Traffic, and IDS Tools.

The gse-study repo's directory and file structure aligns to the GSE primary and sub-categories.

## High-Level Suggest Study Plan

The GSE is a behemoth.  You should start preparing for the lab portion several months in advance.  Also, it is important to note that everyone has varying levels of experience, strenghs and weakenesses, and as a result, the suggested plan should be evaluated and tweaked to match the study methodologies that work best for you:

1. Review all labs for 401, 503, and 504. Re-work the labs twice, making sure to pay keen attention to areas that you need to work on.  It is recommended that you perform each lab with both approached (Approach # 1 (more hints) and Approach # 2 (minimal hints).

2. [For SANS STI Students] Complete NetWars Cyber Defense Continuous 2 times.
	- The first time in an expedited fashion (10-12 hours), in order to simulate the demands and stress levels of the actual exam. 
	- The second  time taking your time - making sure to master all questions, concepts, for every level.
	
3. Review and perform hands-on pcap analysis every day.  Time management is critical for success.  It's also a good to allot 30 minutes per pcap: for both analyzing and writing a quick report on what you've done.

## Using the Study Log Template

There is a spreadsheet entitled, "study-log-template.xlsx" that sits in the repo's main directory.  The spreadsheet provides a starting point for organizing and tracking all of your preparation.
